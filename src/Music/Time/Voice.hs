-- is that 'Note' sustains a single value throughout its duration, while
-- a voice may contain multiple values. It is called voice because it is
-- generalizes the notation of a voice in choral or multi-part instrumental music.
--
-- It may be useful to think about 'Voice' and 'Note' as vectors in time space
-- (i.e. 'Duration'), that also happens to carry around other values, such as pitches.

-- one, and '>>=' transforms the values of a part, allowing the addition and
-- removal of values under relative duration. Perhaps more intuitively, 'join' scales
-- each inner part to the duration of the outer part, then removes the
